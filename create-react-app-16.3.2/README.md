This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It includes a simple setup with a react-router-dom example.

This was from a course with Tyler McGinnis. Next steps include:

* Start building stuff
* Higher order components
* Render Props
* New context API
* More advanced state management libraries like Redux and Mobx
